    "\n",
    "- **Data requirements**: What type of data is required for the organization to be collected, curated, and stored. In addition to this, it is required to categorize the data, numerical or categorical, and the format of storage and dissemination.\n",
    "- **Data collection**: Data collected from several sources must be stored in the correct format and transferred to the right information technology personnel within company. Data can be collected from several objects on several events using different types of sensors and storage tools.\n",
    "- **Data processing**: Preprocessing involves the process of pre-curating the dataset before actual analysis. Common tasks involve correctly exporting the dataset, placing them under the right tables, structuring them, and exporting them in the correct format.\n",
    "- **Data cleaning**: Preprocessed data is still not ready for detailed analysis. It must be correctly transformed for an incompleteness check, duplicates check, error check, and missing value check. These tasks are performed in the data cleaning stage, which involves responsibilities such as matching the correct record, finding inaccuracies in the dataset, understanding the overall data quality, removing duplicate items, and filling in the missing values. Data cleaning is dependent on the types of data under study. Finding data issues on any dataset requires us to perform some analytical techniques, we call it *Data Transformation*.\n",
    "- **EDA**: Is the stage where we actually start to understand the message contained in the data. Several types of data transformation techniques might be required during the process of exploration.\n",
    "- **Modelling and algorithm**: In general, a model always describes the relationship between independent and dependent variables. Inferential statistics deals with quantifying relationships between particular variables. An example of inferential statistic would be regression analysis.\n",
    "- **Data product**: Any computer software that uses data as inputs, produces outputs, and provides feedback based on the output to control the environment is referred to as a data product. A data product is generally based on a model developed during data analysis, for example, a recommendation model that inputs user purchase history and recommends a related item that the user is highly likely to buy.\n",
    "- **Communication**: This stage deals with dissemination the results to end *stakeholders* to use the result for *business intelligence*. One of the most notable steps in this stage is data visualization. Visualization deals with information relay techniques such as tables, charts and summary diagrams to show the analyzed result. "

    "To be certain of the insights that the collected data provides and to make further decisions, data mining is performed where we go through distinctive analysis processes. Exploratory Data Analysis is key, and usually the first exercise in data mining. It allow us to visualize data to understand it as well as to create hypotheses for further analysis. The exploratory analysis centers around creating a synopsis of data or insights for the next steps in a data mining project. EDA actually reveals ground truth about the content without making any underlying assumptions. This is the fact that data scientist use this process to actually understand what type of modeling and and hypotheses can be created. Key components of EDA include *summarizing data*, *statistical analysis*, and *visualization of data*."

The main tasks involved in problem definition are defining the main objective of the analysis, defining the main deliverables, outlining the main roles and responsibilities, obtaining the current status of the data, defining the timetable, and performing cost/benefits analysis.\n",
    "- **Data preparation**: This step involves methods for preparing the dataset before actual analysis. In this step, we define the sources of the data, define data schemas and tables, understand the main characteristics of the data, clean the dataset, delete non-relevant datasets, trasform the data, and divide the data into required chunks for analysis.\n",
    "- **Data analysis**: This is one of the most crucial steps that deals with descriptive statistics and analysis of the data. The main tasks involve *summarizing the data*, *finding the hidden correlation and relationships among the data*, *developing predictive models*, *evaluating the models*, and *calculating the accuracies*. Some of the techniques used for data summarization are summary tables, graphs, descriptive statistics, inferential statistics, correlation statistics, searching, grouping, and mathematical models.\n",
    "- **Development and representation of the results**: This step involves presenting the dataset to the target audience in the form of graphs, summary tables, maps, and diagrams. This is also an essential step as the result analyzed from the dataset should be interpretable by the business stakeholders, which is one of the major steps of EDA. Most of the graphical analysis techiques include scattering plots, character plots, histograms, box plots, residual plots, mean plots, and others. "
